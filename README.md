# GML_Socket_Programming_Code
Example of socket programming in GameMaker Studio (Difficulty: Easy)
Programmed in GML (GameMaker Language)


GameMaker Language is a basic stepping stone language used in GameMaker Studio 1.4.x and 2.x.x
it is compact and easy to understand, it is very similar to C languages, 
however not as powerful in terms of functionality and data structuring.

This example shows:
- Basic (OOP) Language syntax understanding
- Basic Network/Socket Structure knowledge
- Buffers 

You can not run this project outside of a GML compiler!
